Twitter Bot

A Twitter bot using Tweepy library in Python.

To make this work, it needs a all-time running bash console. It can be easily extended by increasing the number of responses in the '''elif''' code.

This will work only with a specific account as the keys are set according to that account.

I made this project using a reference of [CS Dojo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0wWwglE1Vc/).

Files:

my_twitter_bot.py - This is the main file that includes all the logic.

last_seen_id.txt - This will contain the ID of the tweet that my_twitter_bot.py has seen last. If you see any errors when running the main file, try replacing the content with the ID of one of the tweets you want to examine.
