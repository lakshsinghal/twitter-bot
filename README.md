Twitter Bot

A Twitter bot using Tweepy library in Python.

To make this work, it needs a all-time running kernel. It can be easily extended by increasing the number of responses in the '''elif''' code.

This will work only with a specific account as the keys are set accrding to that account.

I made this project using a reference of [CS Dojo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0wWwglE1Vc/).
